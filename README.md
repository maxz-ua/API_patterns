# API Patterns in Java with RestAssured

This repository showcases various design patterns used for building and managing API requests in Java using the RestAssured library.
It includes implementations of several design patterns such as Builder, Decorator, Facade, Factory, Observer, Singleton, and Strategy.

## Features

- **Factory Pattern**: Create API requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) dynamically based on input parameters.
- **Builder Pattern**: Build complex API requests step-by-step.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Implement various validation strategies for API responses.
- **Observer Pattern**: Notify observers about response updates.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Enhance API requests with additional functionalities (e.g., authorization).
- **Facade Pattern**: Provide a simplified interface for complex subsystems.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensure a single instance of configuration management.
